This project is a spotify clone, it's my first React.js.
By the help of this project users can search for their favorite artist (can check popularity and nb of followers) 
and check the albums of that artist (albums,nb of tracks in each album,and release date).
Spotify clone was build using react.js,html, and css. It took about 2 days to have it finished , Understanding the authentication part took some googling to 
understand it fully and to know how to deal with it. In addition, spotifywebapi was used which made the work much easier in fetching both artists and albums
 of that artists upon clicking on artist's card.
