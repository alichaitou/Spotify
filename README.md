This project is a spotify clone, it's my first React.js.
By the help of this project users can search for their favorite artist (can check popularity and number of followers) 
and check the albums of that artist (albums,nb of tracks in each album,and release date).
Spotify clone was build using react.js,html, and css. It took about 2 days to have it finished , Understanding the authentication part took some googling to 
understand it fully and to know how to deal with it. 

To run application :To run the clone all what you have to do is run command "npm start"
